# Improvements

## Current Issues

1. **Metadata Retrieval**
   - CORS issues when trying to fetch metadata directly from radio streams
   - Need for a proxy solution to handle metadata retrieval

2. **Stream Reliability**
   - Connection drops need better handling
   - Automatic reconnection could be more robust

## Planned Improvements

### Short Term

1. **CORS Proxy Implementation**
   - Create a Go-based CORS proxy
   - Deploy on Cloudflare Workers
   - Handle stream metadata efficiently
   - Add caching layer for performance

2. **Player Enhancement**
   - Better error handling
   - More detailed connection status
   - Visual feedback for reconnection attempts

### Medium Term

1. **User Interface**
   - Add favorite stations feature
   - Implement listening history
   - Add station search functionality
   - Improve mobile experience

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize metadata polling
   - Reduce memory usage
   - Implement service worker for offline capabilities

### Long Term

1. **Features**
   - Station discovery system
   - Social sharing options
   - Playlist export
   - Audio equalizer

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Multiple proxy servers
   - Analytics system
   - API for third-party integration

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the codebase simple and maintainable
- Focus on core functionality first
